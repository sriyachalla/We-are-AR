# We-are-AR
Augmented Reality (AR) as a copilot in the digital fabrication and assembly process. Developed prototypes for the workflows of scanning an image and exporting it to fusion, exporting Fusion360 designs to .USDZ, overlay these designs in 3D reality through ipads, and display step-by-step instructions for people to follow for assembly.
