Product Narrative:

Augmented Reality (AR) as a copilot in the digital fabrication and assembly process. 
Developed prototypes for the workflows of scanning an image and exporting it to fusion, exporting Fusion360 designs to .USDZ, overlay these designs in 3D reality through ipads, and display step-by-step instructions for people to follow for assembly.

Project Description:

The AR Copilot app is the result of our team's efforts to create an immersive augmented reality experience for enhancing the furniture assembly process and 3D printer guides. 
Leveraging Apple's ARKit, Reality Composer, and Reality Kit, we have developed a powerful tool that allows users to visualize and interact with assembly instructions in an engaging and intuitive manner. 
The app includes image, object, and surface anchors, enabling users to explore projects like phone stand assembly, table construction, and using the Formlabs Form 2 3D printer. 
Our goal is to make learning and assembly fun, interactive, and accessible for all users.

Process:

Our development process involved a pipeline comprising Reality Composer, ARKit, and Xcode. 
We designed scenes in Reality Composer and exported them to Xcode for app compilation. 
Object detection, anchoring, and user interface were refined iteratively during development. 
We experimented with different techniques to address challenges in object placement, and we learned from each iteration. 
We embraced asynchronous loading to ensure a responsive app experience.
